## ✅ Important Tips

### File Naming Rules (Very Important!)
- ❌ Don't use: `My Research Paper (Final Version).pdf`  
- ✅ Do use: `my-research-paper-2024.pdf`
- No spaces, special characters, or parentheses
- Use dashes (-) or underscores (_) instead

### File Size Guidelines
- Keep files under 10 MB for fast website loading
- If your file is larger, consider compressing it or splitting it

### Writing Good Descriptions
- Write 1-2 sentences that explain what the document is about
- Think about what visitors would want to know before downloading
- Example: "This study examines the role of kinship networks in contemporary Kyrgyz politics and governance structures."
